The code in this repo was modified from [MCD_DA](https://github.com/mil-tokyo/MCD_DA).

Before running the code, you will need to download the [classification track VISDA dataset](https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/taskcv-2017-public/tree/master/classification) and place it in ```./data/``` folder.

Then, the code can be ran by:

```python main.py```

Note that this code was written a long time a ago, and as I do not have a multiple GPU environment at this time, I'm not able to test this code now. Therefore, there might be some minor bugs to run the code, but they should be fixed easily. Please feel free to open an issue or contact me if you found any bugs :)
