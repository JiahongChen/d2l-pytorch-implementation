# L19 Recurrent Neural Networks

As I am not able call the ```load_data_time_machine()``` in ```d2l``` package, and rewrite the whole data preprocessing API will consume quite a lot of time. I'll skipping the training language models used in the textbook. Instead, I will try to find some interesting PyTorch implementations of RNN/GRU/LSTM.
