# Pytorch Implementation for the book "Dive Into Deep Learning"
This repo reproduces codes in the course STAT 157 (UC Berkeley, Fall 2019, https://courses.d2l.ai/) using Pytorch. The textbook for this course is "Dive Into Deep Learning" (http://d2l.ai/). 

Compared to the original MxNet implementation, notebooks in this repo provides more code comments, lecture notes, and it is entirely implemented using pytorch packages. 

This repo also provides code for some interesting algorithms (e.g., Mask-CNN), which was not implemented in the original book/course, using Pytorch pretrained models.
