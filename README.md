# Pytorch Implementation for the book "Dive Into Deep Learning"
This repo reproduces codes in the course STAT 157 (UC Berkeley, Fall 2019, https://courses.d2l.ai/) for book "Dive Into Deep Learning" (http://d2l.ai/), using Pytorch. Compared to the original mxnet implementation, notebooks in this repo provides more code comments, lecture notes, and it is entirely implemented using pytorch packages.
