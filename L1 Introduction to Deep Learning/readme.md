This section of the course (https://courses.d2l.ai/berkeley-stat-157/units/introduction.html) briefly introduces some basic concepts towards deep learning.

For environment setup, you can refer to another repo of my (https://github.com/JiahongChen/Set-up-deep-learning-frameworks-with-GPU-on-Google-Cloud-Platform), which procides a short guide to set up deep learning framework with access to GPU in google cloud platform.
